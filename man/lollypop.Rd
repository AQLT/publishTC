\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{"tc_estimates"} object.}

\item{xlim, ylim}{x and y limits of the plot.
If \code{xlim} is defined and not \code{ylim}, then \code{ylim} is determined automatically.}

\item{col_sa, col_tc}{color of the seasonally adjusted and trend-cycle components.}

\item{color_points, cex_points}{color and size of the points associated to the seasonnaly adjusted component.}

\item{pch_points}{point type of the seasonally adjusted component.}

\item{xlab, ylab}{x and y axis labels.}

\item{lty_last_tc}{line type of the last values of the trend-cycle component.}

\item{n_last_tc}{number of last values of the trend-cycle component to be plotted with a different line type
(to emphasize that there is higher variability for the last estimates).
If \code{NULL}, then \code{n_last_tc} is equal to the bandwidth of the trend-cycle component.}

\item{...}{other parameters.}

\item{legend_tc, legend_sa}{legend of the trend-cycle and seasonally adjusted components.}
